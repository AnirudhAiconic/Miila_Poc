    "🧠 **Imagine You’re in Space!**\nClose your eyes and think: you are flying high above Earth! You float instead of walk, your hair stands up, and your toys drift around. You eat from little pouches and drink with a straw so the juice doesn’t fly away. The spaceship hums softly like a big cat. It feels fun and a little strange, but you are safe inside.",
    "🍽️ **Daily Life on a Spaceship**\nAstronauts wake up when a quiet bell rings. They brush their teeth with tiny drops of water, eat soft food, and play or draw when their work is done. They sleep in special bags so they don’t float around. Every day they look out the window and see Earth — blue and white and beautiful.",
    "🔬 **How a Spaceship Keeps You Alive**\nA spaceship is like a moving house in the sky. Machines clean the air, recycle water, and make sure everyone can breathe. Solar panels outside catch sunlight for power. Inside, astronauts do science experiments and talk to Earth on computers. Every button and cable helps keep them safe far away from home.",
    "💬 **Working and Living Together in Space**\nAstronauts live close together, so teamwork is super important. They share chores, fix things, and help each other when they feel tired or miss their families. They celebrate small moments like birthdays or a new experiment that works. Being kind and calm helps everyone stay happy and safe in space.",
    "⚙️ **The Science of Space Living**\nLife in space is a constant science experiment. Air is filtered and reused, water is recycled, and food is carefully packed for months. Astronauts train their bodies with daily exercise to fight muscle loss. Computers track oxygen, heat, and radiation to keep everything balanced. Living in space teaches humans how to survive anywhere — even on other planets someday.",
    "🎨 **Your Own Spaceship Story**\nImagine you’re designing your own spacecraft. What shape will it have? How will you sleep, eat, and stay healthy? Maybe you’ll grow tiny plants for air and food or build a robot friend for company. Write or tell a short story about your day in space — from sunrise over Earth to the calm of stars at night."
